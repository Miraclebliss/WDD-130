        <p>Hi, my name is Iruka Nkechi Miracle. I’m 24 years old and the fifth child in a family of seven. Born in May, the fifth month—I’ve always believed I was meant for more. 
            I’m studying software development because I want to create real solutions, not just observe problems. To me, coding is more than just a skill it’s a power tool. 
            It doesn’t care where you come from, only what you can build. I want to use it to make a difference and create things that truly matter.</p>
